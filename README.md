### Hi, I'm Colin Zhou ðŸ‘‹

I am an aspiring software engineer who loves to develop useful applications with a fluid user experience. Check out some of my work! Previously, I attended UIUC for my masters degree and Bellevue College for my undergraduate degree in Computer Science. 

I develop mostly using React and TypeScript for the web and am familiar with SQL.
